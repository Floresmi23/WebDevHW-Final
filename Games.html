        <h3>Plank Races</h3>
        <div class="text1">
            <p>Number of People: 4+</p>
            <p>Necessary Equipment: None</p>
            <p>Benefits: Core strengthening</p>
            <p>Plank Races is like a core workout version of “Last Man Sprints,” where you jog as a group in a single file line, and the last person in the line has to sprint to the front. The concept with Plank Races is quite similar, but instead of jogging, you’re holding a plank.</p>
            <p>To play, you’ll split everyone up into two groups. Create start and finish lines that are at least 50 feet (15m) apart, but you’ll want to increase the distance if you have a lot of participants.</p>

        <h3>Obstacle Course</h3>
        <div class="text1">
            <p>Number of People: 2+</p>
            <p>Necessary Equipment: Chairs, tables, benches, balls, etc.</p>
            <p>Benefits: High-intensity cardio, calisthenics</p>
            <p>Who doesn’t love a good ol’ fashioned obstacle course? To set up an obstacle course, you just need a lot of space and some random household objects.</p>
            <p>Chairs, tables, benches, and the like make for great obstacles for people to climb around. Simply set up a course that provides a good mix of running, crawling, climbing, jumping, and other basic calisthenics for a whole body workout.</p>
            <p>Then, you can have people compete in the obstacle course one at a time or in a group. To make it more challenging, you can have participants wear weight vests.</p>
            <p>Another variation to add even more fun: give people a water balloon to carry in their hands throughout the course. This provides an additional challenge and is an excellent way to cool off during the summer months if the balloon pops!</p>
